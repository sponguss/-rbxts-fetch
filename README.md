This package imitates node.js's fetch function for you to use it with roblox-ts.
This is NOT exactly the same as the original fetch, but its close enough. More features will be added with time

## Example
```ts
import { fetch } from "@rbxts/fetch";

fetch("https://example.com").then((res)=>{
    print(res.body)
});
```
